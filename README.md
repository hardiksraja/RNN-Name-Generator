# RNN-Name-Generator

In this project, we give a collection of known Indian baby names and train a model. Using this model, we generate similar looking random new names and also names starting with the user's choice of the alphabet. We use a recurrent neural network (RNN) for this task. 

The training data is a collection of Indian baby names downloaded from the website (http://n3.datasn.io) via an API returning these name collection in JSON format. The dataset consists of 400 names.
